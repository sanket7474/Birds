    <h1 class=" text-center animated fadeInLeft">Ashy Prinia </h1>
    <p class = "animated fadeInUp info">These 13–14&nbsp;cm long warblers have short rounded wings and longish graduated cream tail tipped with black subterminal spots. The tail is usually held upright and the strong legs are used for clambering about and hopping on the ground. They have
        a short black bill. The crown is grey and the underparts are rufous in most plumages. In breeding plumage, adults of the northern population are ash grey above, with a black crown and cheek with no&nbsp;supercilium and&nbsp;rufescent wings. In
        non-breeding season, this population has a short and narrow white supercilium and the tail is longer.They are found singly or in pairs in shrubbery and will often visit the ground.In winter, the northern subspecies,&nbsp;<em>P. s. stewartii</em>        Blyth, 1847, has warm brown upperparts and a longer tail and has seasonal variation in plumage. The other races retain summer plumage all year round. West Bengal and eastwards has race&nbsp;<em>inglisi</em> Whistler &amp; Kinnear, 1933 which is
        darker slaty above than the nominate race of the Peninsula and deeper rufous on the flanks with a finer and shorter beak. The distinctive&nbsp; race in&nbsp;Sri Lanka, <em>P. s. brevicauda</em> Legge, 1879, has a shorter tail and has the juveniles
        with yellowish underparts apart from a distinct call. The song is delivered from the top of a bush and males make fluttery display flights with the tail held up. The ashy prinia builds its nest close to the ground in a shrub or tall grass and
        lays 3–5 eggs. Several types of nests have been described including a flimsy cup made by sewing several large leaves; an oblong purse like structure with grass stems in the structure; and a flimsy ball of grass.The usual nest is placed low in
        a bush and consists of leaves stitched together with webs, lined with hairand having an entrance on the side. The eggs are of a somewhat pointed oval form and exceedingly glossy. They vary from brick-red to rich chestnut in colour, some being
        paler, some darker. The broad end of the egg is generally darker than the remainder of the shell, and exhibits a cap or zone. The eggs measure from 0.6 to 0.68 inches length, and from 0.45 to 0.5 in breadth.The eggs hatch in about 12 days.[12]The
        breeding season varies with locality and has been recorded breeding around the year but mostly after the monsoons. In north India it is mainly June to September and in Sri Lanka mainly December to March or August to October. Breeds during May–June
        in the Nilgiris. The species is believed to be monogamous and both the male and the female take part in incubation and feeding though to varying extents. Parents may spend more time at the nest during cool days.The eggs hatch in about 12 days.Cuckoos
        Cacomantis merulinus and Cacomantis passerinus have been known to be brood parasites of this species. When the nest is threatened by predators such as cats, adults have been observed feigning injury.]Rare cases of birds reusing material from a
        nest to rebuild a nest at a new location have been note</p>
